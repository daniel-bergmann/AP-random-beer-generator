# AP-random-beer-generator

This is a project in the Reykjavik Academy of Web Development.

It has one HTML file that includes both CSS and the JS code.

It was so simple I had it in one file.

A relatively simple project to showcase I am able to manipulate API's and make something with it.

It utilizes the skeleton CSS library for the grids and styling.
